# End to end ai driven pipeline resume parsing model
# Automated Resume Screening and Interview Assistance

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing to streamline the hiring process. It includes modules for generating interview questions, exploratory data analysis (EDA), prediction of candidate selection, and resume screening. The system processes candidate resumes, transcripts, and job descriptions to derive features, perform similarity analysis, and build a predictive model to classify candidates as "select" or "reject."

The project utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to make hiring decisions more efficient and interpretable.

## Features

### General Features:
1. **Automated Interview Question Generation**  
   - Uses the Together API and a job description to create unique, insightful interview questions tailored to specific roles.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzes resume and interview data for trends and insights.  
   - Visualizes correlations, distributions, and decision-making patterns.

3. **Modelling**  
   - Utilizes an SVM model to predict candidate selection.  
   - Features include text similarity, keyword analysis, and decision encoding.

4. **Resume Screening and predictions**  
   - Employs TF-IDF and cosine similarity to match resumes with job descriptions.  
   - Categorizes candidates into match categories (e.g., Excellent Match, Strong Match).

5. ** Automatic Email Integration**  
   - Sends automatic email to the selected candidates.

### Resume and Transcript Processing Features:
- **Text Feature Extraction**: Analyze resumes and transcripts for word count, character count, sentence count, keyword density, and more.
- **Keyword Analysis**: Count technical, positive, and negative keywords in resumes and transcripts.
- **TF-IDF Similarity**: Compute cosine similarity scores between resumes, transcripts, and job descriptions.
- **Predictive Model**: Use an XGBoost classifier to predict hiring decisions based on engineered features.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Perform explainable AI analysis to understand feature importance.
- **Visualization**: Generate SHAP plots, partial dependence plots, and interaction effects for interpretability.
